# deep_learning_toy
Toy deep learning project for getting some hands-on experience with keras and tensorflow - Thanks and credits to https://medium.com/the-andela-way/deep-learning-hello-world-e1fc53ea888

Example to perform a classification on the MNIST dataset.

Download the MNIST image dataset from  http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Install the dependencies:
python-minst
tensorflow
keras
tqdm
h5py

Create the following folders in the root you are storing network.py and data_load.py files:
models: for the trained model to be saved
data: for the mnist dataset to be extracted into

Once done, run the code using ```python network.py``` from the terminal.
